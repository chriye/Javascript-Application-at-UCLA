**Overview**
A website that allows users to play Shut The Box. 

Before you enter a valid password(Immutable), all pages will direct you to a login page. Once you enter with a valid password, a valid username is needed. If usernames are not valid, an instruction will be shown via an alert window once you submit it. When usernames meet all qualifications, users are ready to play the game. The game rule is users roll a pair of dice. Next, users have to select two numbers or one number from 0 to 9, and add them up to be equal to the sum of dice/die numbers. If the sum of selected numbers does not match, an alert window will be shown to tell you that. Otherwise, the selected numbers will be disabled, which indicates that numbers 0 to 9 can only be selected one time. Keep doing these steps till the user can't find any numbers that are equivalent to the sum of dice/die numbers. When the sum of remaining unselected buttons numbers is less than or equal to 6, a die will be rolled instead. While users can't make further steps, there's a Quit button that's for users to quit the game and get a score. The Quit button will redirect users to a score page that shows all users' scores in order. Moreover, it will update other users' scores every 8 seconds without refreshing the page manually.

**Notice**
A blank scores.txt file should be included in Github. Due to the file is blank initially, it's not allowed to upload/create.
